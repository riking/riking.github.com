Being a phony / hypocrite is to perform actions that conflict with words, whether spoken or written. The action, here, could also be speaking or talking. For example, you're a politician saying that you oppose abortion "in all circumstances". However, when someone else impregnates your wife, you rush her over and get an abortion as soon as possible. That's pretty much as clear of an example of a turnaround as you can get. Or another example - maybe you always extoll the virtues of gun safety, but whenever you're on the ranges, you start waving it all around. Holden also consideres a person to be a 'phony' if they try to have a 'public face' and a 'private face' - by that definition, politicians would have to be the biggest phonies of all, because they always separate their public and private lives. I don't exactly agree with that definition, though - separation of responsibilities is totally reasonable, and it prevents your opponents from taking trivial matters and using them as ammunition against you. Holden also engages in 'phony' behavior in the book, though. He almost spells it out sometimes - saying that something 'killed' him but that he was smiling and nodding.

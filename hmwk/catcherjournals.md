Being a phony / hypocrite is to perform actions that conflict with words, whether spoken or written. The action, here, could also be speaking or talking. For example, you're a politician saying that you oppose abortion "in all circumstances". However, when someone else impregnates your wife, you rush her over and get an abortion as soon as possible. That's pretty much as clear of an example of a turnaround as you can get. Or another example - maybe you always extoll the virtues of gun safety, but whenever you're on the ranges, you start waving it all around. Holden also consideres a person to be a 'phony' if they try to have a 'public face' and a 'private face' - by that definition, politicians would have to be the biggest phonies of all, because they always separate their public and private lives. I don't exactly agree with that definition, though - separation of responsibilities is totally reasonable, and it prevents your opponents from taking trivial matters and using them as ammunition against you. Holden also engages in 'phony' behavior in the book, though. He almost spells it out sometimes - saying that something 'killed' him but that he was smiling and nodding.

For my personal 'character', the area most in need of development is focusing my efforts on the right goals. That's multiple parts:
 - focusing my efforts
 - doing efforts on the right goals
For example, I can work hard on something, but that something might not be related to school (which should be my overall goal right now). And I can work on something for school, but I need to be able to be focused when I need to be.  
This is a problem because when I go to college, I won't have anyone else to remind me of what I need to be doing. Also, many college assignments will be long-term, and that's the main result of these problems - I ~~can't~~ _haven't been able to_ get myself to do anything really long-term by myself these last few months.

Naming a group as the biggest hypocrites on campus, when the groups are as big as "Students, Teachers, or Administrators", is quite a dangerous generalization. There are bound to be people in each group who both fit and don't fit your definitions of a hypocrite. However, I will take the analysis in the spirit of only looking at what aspects are shared in general among all members.

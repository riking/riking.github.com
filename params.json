My name is Kane York. I and my brother both often go by the name of Riking. He's more into games than I am, so if you see a Riking in a game, it's probably him. I frequent `irc.esper.net` and sometimes offer help to people making Minecraft mods. \r\n\r\nI've had experience with programming Java, Python, Lua, and Windows Batch (still hate it).\r\n\r\nMy first-ever standalone program was \"McModChooser\", written in Windows Batch script. The code is now hosted at https://github.com/riking/mcmodchooser. \r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

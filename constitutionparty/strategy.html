    <p>Since the Constitution Party is not one of the two main parties,
    we must make sure to spread our views across the states, without
    relying on social media. We can achieve this with the following methods:

<ul>
<li>
Campaigning through college visits, with presentations for the student population</li>
<li>
Organizing rallies in every state, where Goode and Clymer will visit.</li>
<li>
Fundraising by acquiring donations/using own funds</li>
<li>
Appealing to interest groups that support pro-life, right for guns(National Rifle Association), elimination of foreign aid/policy, pro-auditing the federal reserve, elimination of green cards, not supporting illegal immigrants</li>
<li>
Visiting every state and organizing press conferences, for news reporters to cover</li>
<li>
Focus on developing relations with the public in order to have emotional appeal</li>
<li>
Target door to door neighborhoods </li>
<li>
Hire volunteers to call households</li>
<li>
Hand out advertisements through mail</li>
<li>
Start campaigning earlier than other parties</li>
<li>
Define views and compare against other parties in order to appeal to those who do not fully agree with the main two political parties</li>
<li>
For Virgil Goode’s speech make sure to address these concerns, so that our platform is established.</li>
<li>
Appeal to Republican states and consider the states that voted for Mitt Romney in the election of 2012, since they are more in line with our views. These states include: Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Alaska</li>
<li>
Since Republicans are more in line with our ideas, it is better to target Republican leaning states. However, we must also campaign in Democratic states as well; especially ones with a high amount of Representative votes for the electoral college.</li>
<li>
Refer back to the 2012 election, and take note of states that gave us ballot access and write-in access:
<ul>
<li>Alabama</li><li>Colorado</li><li>Florida</li><li>Idaho</li><li>Iowa</li><li>Louisiana</li><li>Michigan</li><li>Minnesota</li><li>Missouri</li><li>Mississippi</li><li>New Hampshire</li><li>New Jersey</li><li>New Mexico</li><li>New York</li><li>Nevada</li><li>North Dakota</li><li>Ohio</li><li>Rhode Island</li><li>South Carolina</li><li>South Dakota</li><li>Tennessee</li><li>Utah</li><li>Virginia</li><li>Washington</li><li>Wisconsin</li><li>Wyoming</li><li>Arizona</li><li>California</li><li>District of Columbia</li><li>Georgia</li><li>Illinois</li><li>Indiana</li><li>Kentucky</li><li>Maryland</li><li>Montana</li><li>Nebraska</li><li>North Carolina</li><li>Oregon</li><li>Pennsylvania</li><li>Texas</li><li>Vermont</li><li>West Virginia</li>
These states have supporters of ours, which mean more votes can be counted towards us.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these methods are achieved, we may be able to succeed in making Goode as our country’s  president for the presidential term of 2016-2020.</p>

    <p>The mission of the Constitution Party is to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity through the election, at all levels of government, of Constitution Party candidates.

    These candidates are those whom will uphold the principles of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights. It is our goal to limit the federal government to its delegated, enumerated, Constitutional functions.</p>

    <h3 class="redslash">Fiscal Responsibility</h3>

    <p>Budget considerations are greatly impacted by the ever rising national 
debt. Interest on the debt is one of the largest expenses of 
government, and unless the interest is paid, the debt will continue to 
grow as interest is added to interest. We must eliminate the debt in the 
shortest reasonable time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not spending more than collected revenues</li>
<li>Paying interest as it accrues</li>
<li>Making annual reductions in the principal</li></ul>
<p>We could eliminate the debt more rapidly by selling certain lands and 
other federal assets, including foreign military bases, and applying the 
proceeds exclusively to debt reduction.</p>
<p>One of the greatest contributors to deficit spending is war. If the 
country is to eliminate debt, these United States cannot become 
gratuitously involved in constant wars. Constitutional government, as 
the founders envisioned it, was not imperial. It was certainly not 
contemplated that America would police the world at the taxpayers' 
expense.</p>
<p>We reject the misleading use of the terms "surplus" and "balanced 
budget" as long as we have public debt. We oppose dishonest 
accounting practices such as "off-budget items" used to hide 
unconstitutional spending practices.</p>
